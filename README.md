For the best user experience its strongly recommended to use a XBox 360 Controller.

Fire a color bullet with the corresponding button:
* Button-**A**: Green
* Button-**B**: Red
* Button-**X**: Blue
* Button-**Y**: Yellow

### Keyboard
Use **left** and **right** to rotate your cannon around the base.

Fire a color bullet with the corresponding number:
* **1**: Green
* **2**: Red
* **3**: Blue
* **4**: Yellow

## Technology
The game is written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) with the newest [Kotlin 1.1 Beta](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/01/kotlin-1-1-beta-is-here/)-update.
For the platform independent runtime the game framework [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is used.
